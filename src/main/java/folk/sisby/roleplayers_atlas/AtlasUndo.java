 * Taking back the last thing drawn.

 * Every tool in the atlas draws straight onto the map, and until now every one
 * of them was a one-way road: a stroke of the town brush across the wrong
 * valley, a zone rubbed out to nothing, a mark erased by a slipped click. None
 * of it could be got back. This keeps the last twenty things done and how to
 * undo each, which costs nothing while nothing goes wrong and everything when
 * it does.
 * <p>
 * What is stored is the <em>inverse</em> action, not a copy of the map: putting
 * a landmark back, painting a set of cells the colour they were, restoring a
 * correction to what it said before. Running one is done with recording turned
 * off, so undoing doesn't pile another step onto the stack.
 * <p>
 * The stack belongs to one world and is emptied when it changes — a step that
 * says "put this landmark back" means nothing in a world that never had it.
